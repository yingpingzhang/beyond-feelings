# What Is Critical Thinking ?

## mind and brain

1 many philosophers argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity.

2 One especially important issue is whether the mind is passive, a blank slate on which experience writes, as John Locke held, or active, a vehicle by which we take the initiative and exercise our free will, as G. W. Leibnitz argued.

## What Is Critical Thinking?

The essence of critical thinking is evaluation . Critical thinking, therefore, may be defined as the process by which we test claims and arguments and determine which have merit and which do not. In other words, critical thinking is a search for answers, a quest . Not surprisingly, one of the most important techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions .

## Characteristics of Critical Thinkers

1 A number of misconceptions exist about critical thinking. One is that being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker.Another misconception is that critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action.It is also a misconception that critical thinking is synonymous with having a lot of right answers in one’s head. And yet another misconception is that critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either has it or does not.

2 We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers—skill in asking appropriate questions. Another is control of one’s mental activities. John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us care to admit is spent “trifling with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.” Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious drift of images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter, examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, in other words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their minds actively as well as passively.

## The Role of Intuition

1 Intuition is commonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension of something—that is, sensing or understanding something without the use of reasoning.

2 Breakthrough ideas favor trained, active minds. It is unusual for someone totally untrained in a subject to make a significant new discovery about it. Thus, if Kekule had been a plumber, Goethe a book-keeper, and Coleridge a hairdresser, they would almost certainly not have received the intuitions for which they are famous.

## Avoiding Plagiarism

Step 2: As you read each source, note the ideas you want to refer to in your writing. If the author’s words are unusually clear and concise, copy them exactly and put quotation marks around them. Otherwise, paraphrase —that is, restate the author’s ideas in your own words. Write down the number(s) of the page(s) on which the author’s passage appears.If the author’s idea triggers a response in your mind—such as a question, a connection between this idea and something else you’ve read, or an experience of your own that supports or challenges what the author says—write it down and put brackets (not parentheses) around it so that “you will be able to identify it as your own when you review your notes.
